      "    Content: process that requires a lot of experimentation to get optimal results. Using a simple playground from OpenAI or Cohere is a good starting point.\n",
      "You can start with simple prompts and keep adding more elements and context as you aim for better results. Iterating your prompt along the way is vital for this reason. As you read the guide, you will see many examples where specificity, simplicity, and conciseness will often give you better results.\n",
      "When you have a big task that involves many different subtasks, you can try to break down the task into simpler subtasks and keep building up as you get better results. This avoids adding too much complexity to the prompt design process at the beginning.\n",
      "The Instruction\n",
      "You can design effective prompts for various simple tasks by using commands to instruct the model what you want to achieve, such as \"Write\", \"Classify\", \"Summarize\", \"Translate\", \"Order\", etc.\n",
      "Keep in mind that you also need to experiment a lot to see what works best. Try different instructions with different keywords, contexts, and data and see what works best for your particular use case and task. Usually, the more specific and relevant the context is to the task you are trying to perform, the better. We will touch on the importance of sampling and adding more context in the upcoming guides.\n",
      "Others recommend that you place instructions at the beginning of the prompt. Another recommendation is to use some clear separator like \"###\" to separate the instruction and context.\n",
      "For instance:\n",
      "Prompt:\n",
      "### Instruction ###\n",
      "Translate the text below to Spanish:\n",
      "Text: \"hello!\"\n",
      "Output:\n",
      "¡Hola!\n",
      "Specificity\n",
      "Be very specific about the instruction and task you want the model to perform. The more descriptive and detailed the prompt is, the better the results. This is particularly important when you have a desired outcome or style of generation you are seeking. There aren't specific tokens or keywords that lead to better results. It's more important to have a good format and descriptive prompt. In fact, providing examples in the prompt is very effective to get desired output in specific formats.\n",
      "When designing prompts, you should also keep in mind the length of the prompt as there are limitations regarding how long the prompt can be. Thinking about how specific and detailed you should be. Including too many unnecessary details is not necessarily a good approach. The details should be relevant and contribute to the task at hand.\n",

      "The sky is blue on a clear day. On a cloudy day, the sky may be gray or white.\n",

This approach of designing optimal prompts to instruct the model to perform a task is what's referred to as prompt engineering.\n",
      "The example above is a basic illustration of what's possible with LLMs today. Today's LLMs are able to perform all kinds of advanced tasks that range from text summarization to mathematical reasoning to code generation.\n",

Some large language models do have the ability to perform zero-shot prompting but it depends on the complexity and knowledge of the task at hand.\n",

      "ChatGPT Introduction\n",
      "ChatGPT is a new model trained by OpenAI (opens in a new tab) that has the capability to interact in a conversational way. This model is trained to follow instructions in a prompt to provide appropriate responses in the context of a dialogue. ChatGPT can help with answering questions, suggesting recipes, writing lyrics in a certain style, generating code, and much more.\n",
      "ChatGPT is trained using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). While this model is a lot more capable than previous GPT iterations (and also trained to reduce harmful and untruthful outputs), it still comes with limitations. Let's cover some of the capabilities and limitations with concrete examples.\n",
      "You can use the research preview of ChatGPT here but for the examples below we will use the Chat mode on the OpenAI Playground.\n",
      "Reviewing The Conversation Task\n",
      "In one of the previous guides, we covered a bit about conversation capabilities and role prompting. We covered how to instruct the LLM to have a conversation in a specific style, with a specific intent, behavior, and identity.\n",
      "Let's review our previous basic example where we created a conversational system that's able to generate more technical and scientific responses to questions.\n",
      "Prompt:\n",
      "The following is a conversation with an AI research assistant. The assistant tone is technical and scientific.\n",
      "Human: Hello, who are you?\n",
      "AI: Greeting! I am an AI research assistant. How can I help you today?\n",
      "Human: Can you tell me about the creation of black holes?\n",

      "From the example above, you can see two important components:\n",
      "the intent or explanation of what the chatbot is\n",
      "the identity which instructs the style or tone the chatbot will use to respond\n",
      "The simple example above works well with the text completion APIs that uses text-davinci-003. More recently, OpenAI announced the ChatGPT APIs (opens in a new tab), which is a more powerful and cheaper model called gpt-3.5-turbo was specifically built for this type of functionality (chat completions).

      "SPARK: Sure! Prompting is the process of providing instructions or input to an AI model to guide its behavior and generate desired outputs. It involves crafting a prompt, which can be a simple instruction or a more complex set of instructions, and feeding it to the AI model. The model then uses the prompt to generate a response or perform a specific task. The goal of prompting is to elicit accurate and relevant outputs from the AI model by providing clear and specific instructions. Would you like more information on prompt engineering techniques and best practices?\n",
